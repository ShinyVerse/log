  [Oystercard Challenge](https://github.com/ShinyVerse/oystercard)

  Working alongside Marianne Radchid, we built this project with 4 classes, starting with one, Oystercard. From Oystercard we extracted out new classes, using the TDD approach.
  Coach Sam gave us a code review and confirmed it looked good, only a few minor changes of some attr_reader items to be moved into a private attr_reader.
